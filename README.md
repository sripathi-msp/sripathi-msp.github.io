# SRIPATHI M — Penetration Tester & OSINT Investigator  
### Web Application Security • API Pentesting • Vulnerability Assessment • Digital Footprint OSINT

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
I specialize in identifying and validating security vulnerabilities in **web applications, APIs, and network environments**, and performing **OSINT investigations** for digital footprint analysis.

I follow industry-standard methodologies including **OWASP**, **PTES**, **MITRE**, and responsible disclosure practices.

## 🛡️ What I Do

### ✔ Web Application Penetration Testing  
Testing based on OWASP Top 10, including:
- SQL Injection  
- XSS (Reflected, Stored)  
- Broken Authentication  
- Authorization Bypass (IDOR)  
- CSRF  
- SSRF (Basic)  
- File Upload Bypass  
- Server & Framework Misconfigurations  

### ✔ API Security Testing  
Testing REST APIs for:
- Broken Object Level Authorization  
- Authentication flaws  
- Rate-limit bypass  
- Sensitive data exposure  

### ✔ Network Vulnerability Assessment  
Scanning & validating:
- Open ports  
- SMB/FTP/SSH issues  
- Outdated services  
- Misconfigurations  

### ✔ OSINT Investigations  
Digital footprint mapping:
- Username & email investigation  
- Metadata extraction  
- Breach exposure checks  
- Domain/IP intelligence  
- Social media research  

All OSINT work is 100% legal and uses public sources only.
